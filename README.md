The analysis is done for partial fulfillment of Evidence-Based Business Analytics course offered for students enrolled in Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at [**Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM)**](https://som.ku.edu.np/). For the analysis, a dataset named [*HR Analytics Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/hr-analytics-dataset) was selected from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of multiple columns with more than 1000 rows. Initally we studied the data and took decision on which columns to include and which to exclude. After the decision was made *Power query* was used to clean the data and reach the [desired dataset](https://github.com/koirala99/Pair-Project/blob/main/Working%20file.xlsx).

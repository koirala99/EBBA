The analysis is done for partial fulfillment of Evidence-Based Business Analytics course offered for students enrolled in Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at [**Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM)**](https://som.ku.edu.np/). For the analysis, a dataset named [*HR Analytics Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/hr-analytics-dataset) was selected from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of multiple columns with more than 1000 rows. Initally we studied the data and took decision on which columns to include and which to exclude. After the decision was made *Power query* was used to clean the data and reach the [desired dataset](https://github.com/koirala99/Pair-Project/blob/main/Working%20file.xlsx). While cleaning undesired columns along will any null values containing rows were excluded. After the data was cleaned, Power BI was used for preparing [visualization](https://github.com/koirala99/Pair-Project/blob/main/Analytics.pbix) through which insights could be drawn. Through the visualization, insights regarding the characteristics and demographics of the employees were identified. Further we had prepared few questions about the cause of employee attrition and income determinants of employees which were answered through the use of visualizations. Lastly, we have listed the major findings of the analysis which is beneficial for organizaitons to reduce their employee attrition rate.
